# JavaScript Samples

The samples included in this project were developed for use in an
introductory JavaScript course at Johnson County Community College in
Overland Park, KS. Each sample includes comments explaining what
tasks should be done to complete the sample. While the "master" branch
contains starting prompts, the "solutions" branch contains possible
solutions for each sample.

## Circles

*Purpose:* Practice creating objects with methods that require use of
  'this'.

## Dice Roller

*Purpose:* Use the Math object to generate random numbers. Practice
  DOM manipulation by selecting the number of dice to roll and
  updating the page after rolling the dice.

## Keypad

*Purpose*: Practice using HTMLCollections and attaching a single event
  handler to multiple elements. The event target can be used to
  determine the source of the event.

## Snippets

*Purpose:* Practice use of functions and objects. Functions should be
  used to break down a program into smaller parts with a specific task.
  Objects should be used to hold data that can be displayed on the page.
